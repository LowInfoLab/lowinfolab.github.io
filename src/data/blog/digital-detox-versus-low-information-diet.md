description: A detox can be a reset, but the low information diet offers a sustainable way to stay intentional with your inputs. Here’s how they differ.

The term “digital detox” has become popular in recent years. It usually means stepping away from screens for a weekend, a week, or sometimes longer. Many people find detoxes refreshing, but the benefits often fade as soon as you reconnect.

The [low information diet](../posts/the-low-information-diet-your-blueprint-for-digital-minimalism#what-the-low-information-diet-really-means) takes a different approach. Instead of pausing your habits temporarily, it reshapes them permanently.

## The Short-Term Reset

A detox can help you reset your relationship with technology. It can remind you what life feels like without constant inputs. But detoxes are like diets in the food world — powerful for a short burst, difficult to sustain long-term.

## The Sustainable Practice

The low information diet is less about escape and more about intention. You don’t need to quit technology. You need to master it. That means curating sources, setting strong boundaries, and building habits that prevent [information overload](../posts/the-low-information-diet-your-blueprint-for-digital-minimalism#why-information-overload-is-a-modern-epidemic) from creeping back.

## Which One Should You Choose?

If you feel overwhelmed, a detox can give you immediate relief. But if you want lasting change, you need a practice that extends beyond a single weekend. That’s what makes the low information diet a blueprint for long-term digital minimalism.
